                                                                             Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Data
In this extensive SQL project, I delved into the exploration of COVID-19 data spanning from January 28, 2020, to April 30, 2021 using the Microsoft SQL Server(SSMS). Leveraging a variety of SQL techniques, I conducted data exploration, joined tables, utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and employed Temp Tables to extract valuable insights from the pandemic dataset.

Data Exploration and Filtering:

Explored and filtered COVID-19 data, focusing on continents, locations, and key metrics.
Utilized Temp Tables for efficient data organization.
Risk Analysis: Total Cases vs. Total Deaths

Calculated the likelihood of death if contracting COVID-19 in a specific country.
Presented data illustrating the ratio of total deaths to total cases.
Population Impact: Total Cases vs. Population

Analyzed the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
Explored countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.
Global Insights: Highest Infection Rates and Death Counts

Identified countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population.
Continent-specific Analysis: Death Counts per Population

Examined continents with the highest death counts per population.
Global Overview: Cumulative New Cases, Total Deaths, and Death Percentage

Aggregated global numbers, including new cases, total deaths, and death percentage.
Vaccination Analysis: Population Vaccination Progress

Explored the percentage of the population that received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.
Utilized CTEs for efficient calculation on Partition By in previous queries.
Employed Temp Tables to perform calculations on Partition By, storing results for further analysis.
Data Visualization Preparation: Creating a View

Established a View to store data for subsequent visualization and reporting.
Throughout this project, I applied a diverse set of SQL skills, including Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Data Type Conversions. The analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitating data-driven decision-making and further exploration.
